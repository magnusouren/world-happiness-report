      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Country name</strong>: Name of the country.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Regional indicator</strong>: Region to which the country
          belongs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ladder score</strong>: The happiness score for each country,
          based on responses to the Cantril Ladder question that asks
          respondents to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them
          being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Log GDP per capita</strong>: The natural logarithm of the
          country's GDP per capita, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP)
          to account for differences in the cost of living between countries.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Social support</strong>: The national average of binary
          responses (either 0 or 1 representing No/Yes) to the question about
          having relatives or friends to count on in times of trouble.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Healthy life expectancy</strong>: The average number of years
          a newborn infant would live in good health, based on mortality rates
          and life expectancy at different ages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Freedom to make life choices</strong>: The national average of
          responses to the question about satisfaction with freedom to choose
          what to do with one's life.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Generosity</strong>: The residual of regressing the national
          average of responses to the question about donating money to charity
          on GDP per capita.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Perceptions of corruption</strong>: The national average of
          survey responses to questions about the perceived extent of corruption
          in the government and businesses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dystopia + residual</strong>: Dystopia is an imaginary country
          with the worldâ€™s least-happy people, used as a benchmark for
          comparison. The dystopia + residual score is a combination of the
          Dystopia score and the unexplained residual for each country, ensuring
          that the combined score is always positive. Each of these factors
          contributes to the overall happiness score, but the Dystopia +
          residual value is a benchmark that ensures no country has a lower
          score than the hypothetical Dystopia.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Positive affect</strong>: The national average of responses to
          questions about positive emotions experienced yesterday.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Negative affect</strong>: The national average of responses to
          questions about negative emotions experienced yesterday.
